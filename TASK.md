## Top 100 Movies - Frontend Task
### Create the homepage of a imaginary streaming service with listing of top 100 movies.
====================

Spend as little or as much time as you would like. Complete as much as you can, with the focus on functionality and aesthetics.

Imagine that you're creating new website for company that will be Netflix competitor. This website needs to display the top 100 movies based on the iTunes API.

#### Base Requirements
-------
- Show top 100 movies based on the json feed: https://itunes.apple.com/us/rss/topmovies/limit=100/json
- Clean, readable, maintainable codebase
- A good user experience
- Code added to your GitHub repository
- Show us your work through your commit history!

#### Optional
-------
+ Use a JavaScript framework (Angular, React, Backbone, etc)
+ Use SASS or LESS for custom CSS
+ Make use of animations
+ Allow the top 100 to be searchable
+ Allow the user to see more information about a selected Movie
+ Host the site on the service of your choice (AWS, Azure, github.io address, etc)

-------
### Bonus Round
+ Use a language that compiles to JavaScript (CoffeeScript, TypeScript, Dart, etc)
+ Surprise us! Add a feature that you think would work well here (for instance, advanced search, integration with other API, a "Favorite" functionality)
